##AI-Driven Pathfinding with A* Algorithm

Overview
This project implements the A* (A-star) algorithm to identify the most efficient path for a robot navigating a 100x100 grid, avoiding obstacles. The approach ensures optimal performance in terms of time and distance while accommodating barriers. The robot's movement is restricted to adjacent cells in eight possible directions.

Features
Algorithm: A* algorithm with customizable heuristics.
Grid-Based Simulation: Handles pathfinding on a 100x100 grid with variable obstacle densities.
Realistic Constraints: Incorporates movement restrictions and dynamic environments.
Performance Analysis: Evaluates success rates, path costs, and computational time across different obstacle densities.
